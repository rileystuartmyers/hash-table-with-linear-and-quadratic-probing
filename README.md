# hash-table-with-linear-and-quadratic-probing
Creates a hash map using a dynamic int array and provides hashing functionality, including linear and quadratic probing.

Input files consist of a line specifying the size of the array, a line that declares linear or quadratic probing, and a third line that consists of space separated integers that will be inserted into the array.

Basic functions are included for insertion, searching, and printing.

Output files consist of a comma-separated list of integers representing the contents of the hash table, and a second line with contents of the heap.
